A simple script for inputting a list of names, and recording the time it takes to do so.

A question recently came to me: how many names does the average person know? If someone just sat down and started writing out as many names they could think of, how big could that list become? Names would come to mind quickly at first, but the number is not infinite. I decided to write a program that would record not only names, but the time it takes to think of each name. Then I could look for the point where naming slows down, and draw out a curve that may predict when naming would be exhausted.
